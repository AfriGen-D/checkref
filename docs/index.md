## Quick Start

Run the pipeline with minimal configuration:

```bash
# Install Nextflow
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# Run with test data
nextflow run AfriGen-D/checkref -profile test,docker --outdir results

# Run with your data
nextflow run AfriGen-D/checkref \
    --targetVcfs "sample*.vcf.gz" \
    --referenceDir /path/to/reference/panels/ \
    --fixMethod correct \
    --outdir results \
    -profile docker
```

## Pipeline Overview

CheckRef performs seven key steps:

1. **VCF Validation** - Assess file integrity and format compliance
2. **Chromosome Detection** - Automatically identify chromosomes from filenames
3. **Reference Matching** - Pair VCF files with corresponding legend files
4. **Allele Switch Detection** - Compare REF/ALT orientations against reference
5. **Correction/Removal** - Fix allele switches or remove problematic sites
6. **Verification** - Validate that corrections were successful
7. **Results Aggregation** - Generate comprehensive summary reports

## Use Cases

- **Quality Control** before genotype imputation
- **Data Harmonization** across different reference panels
- **Genomic Data Cleaning** for association studies
- **Reference Panel Preparation** for population genetics research
